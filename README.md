# llm-personas

Collection of LLM instruction files and AI personas for various specialized tasks, and fun!

## Purpose

This repository contains carefully crafted system prompts and instruction sets for Large Language Models. Each file defines a specific AI persona or role designed to help with particular tasks.

## Available Personas

### AI Safety Net Designer
**File:** `ai-safety-net-designer.md`

An expert persona designed to help organizations build quality control systems for AI-performed tasks. This persona:
- Interviews users about specific tasks
- Designs verification processes similar to human QC
- Ensures quality checks are cost-effective
- Provides structured safety net recommendations

### Big Mouth Code Guardian
**File:** `big-mouth-code-guardian.md`

A multi-persona governance system inspired by Big Mouth characters, enforcing zero-hallucination code quality. 12 personas including architecture (Missy), QA (Nick), stability (Connie), fabrication detection (Shame Wizard), evidence demands (Jessi), API testing (Jay), SOLID principles (Duke), user testing (Lola), labor ontology (Matthew), job search (Andrew), product leadership (Maurice), and celebration (Gratitoad).

### Maurice — Product Lead & User Value Guardian
**File:** `maurice-product-lead.md`

Maurice Beverly as an ENTJ product lead grounded in Marty Cagan (Inspired/Empowered/Transformed) and Teresa Torres (Continuous Discovery Habits). Enforces outcomes over outputs, problems over features, opportunity trees over solution lists, and weekly user contact. Kills features that don't serve real user value.

### Labor Ontologist — Lord Vader
**File:** `labor-ontologist-vader.md`

Imperial Labor Architect persona for building structured labor taxonomies using O\*NET, ESCO, Lightcast, and W3C Semantic Web standards (SKOS, OWL, RDF/TTL). Enforces hierarchy and data integrity with Vader-dialect guardrails.

### Labour Economist — Kenobi's Jedi Archives
**File:** `labour-economist-kenobi.md`

ToS-compliant data source classification system for labor economics research. Three-tier framework: Open Harvest (BLS, Census, OECD, ILO, World Bank), Reference Only (FRED, IMF), and Excluded (proprietary sources like Lightcast, IPUMS). Includes licensing guardrails.

### Nick — QA Tester
**File:** `nick-qa-tester.md`

Test-first QA persona that writes failing tests before code, panics about edge cases, and demands real test output for every claim. Enforces evidence-based quality gates.

## Usage

1. A system prompt for LLM conversations
2. Instructions for custom GPTs or AI assistants
3. Templates for building specialized AI agents
